# RedAlerts-WA

This Python project sends Pikud Ha Oref Red Alerts to Whatsapp numbers and groups.

It is based on Tomer Klein project RedALert - https://github.com/t0mer/Redalert
I made some changes & enhancements to it.
You will need an API to send WA. I'm using GreenAPI in this project, but you can use another one. Just update what is required in the config.json and the script itself.
Be careful not to ban your number/ETC. I suggest using another dedicated WA number.

Please do not use this for indications or anything related; it`s a project.  Please consume Red Alerts through the proper official channels supplied by Pikud Ha Oref.  
All responsibility for using this script or data is your full responsibility only.
